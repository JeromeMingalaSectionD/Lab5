# Music Website
 This is a short descrpition of the design choices and development process of my Music Website.
 
## Design Choices
 The design is simply as to simply show off the content, the background has a slight gradiant to make the page pop a little more. The color pallete is simple and only uses 3 colors. Overall it is a simple design and dosen't have anything extra.

 ## Development Process
  During the development process and coding process overall it was very simple, All of the content is in the form of cards and multimedia links. The css is still messy as I am still learning but overall it is a lot better than some of my other labs. The HTML is very simple due to the fact of only using cards and making a simple form. Overall the development process was a lot smoother as my coding experience is improving.
